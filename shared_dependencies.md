Shared Dependencies:

1. **Hugo Configuration**: The `config.toml` file is a shared dependency as it contains the site-wide configuration for the Hugo static site generator. This includes the site title, theme, language, and other parameters that are used across all the other files.

2. **Docsy Theme**: The `themes/docsy` directory is a shared dependency as it contains the Docsy theme files that are used to style and structure the entire site. This includes the HTML templates, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files that are used across all the other files.

3. **Content Files**: The `content/_index.md`, `content/about.md`, `content/services.md`, `content/portfolio.md`, and `content/contact.md` files are shared dependencies as they contain the Markdown content for the respective pages of the site. These files use the Hugo front matter format, which includes metadata such as the page title, description, and layout that are used across all the other files.

4. **Static Files**: The `static/images/logo.png`, `static/images/favicon.ico`, `static/css/custom.css`, and `static/js/custom.js` files are shared dependencies as they contain the static assets for the site. These files are directly served by Hugo and are used across all the other files.

5. **Layout Partials**: The `layouts/partials/custom-header.html` and `layouts/partials/custom-footer.html` files are shared dependencies as they contain the HTML partials for the header and footer of the site. These files are included in the main layout template and are used across all the other files.

6. **DOM Elements**: The JavaScript functions in the `static/js/custom.js` file may use various DOM elements that are defined in the HTML templates. The id names of these DOM elements are shared dependencies.

7. **CSS Classes**: The CSS styles in the `static/css/custom.css` file may use various CSS classes that are defined in the HTML templates. The names of these CSS classes are shared dependencies.
