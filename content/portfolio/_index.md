## Our Work

We've had the privilege of working with some amazing startups and helping them bootstrap their docs team. Here are a few examples of our work:

### Startup A

We helped Startup A establish their documentation process from scratch, using open source tools and a Docs-as-code methodology.

### Startup B

For Startup B, we revamped their existing documentation process, making it more efficient and easier to maintain.

### Startup C

Startup C needed a documentation process that could scale with their rapidly growing team. We delivered a solution that not only met their current needs but also set them up for future success.

We're proud of the work we've done and the companies we've helped. If you're interested in learning more about our services, please [contact us](/contact/).
