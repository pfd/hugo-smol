As an AI, I'm unable to execute commands or install packages. However, I can provide you with the commands you need to run in your terminal to install the Docsy theme as a Hugo module.

Please run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/google/docsy.git
```

Then, in your `config.toml` file, add the following lines to use Docsy as a Hugo module:

```toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/google/docsy"
```

Remember to update your Hugo version to the latest one (0.71 or later) to ensure compatibility with the Docsy theme. You can do this by running:

```bash
brew upgrade hugo
```

Please note that these commands are for a Unix-like operating system such as Linux or MacOS. If you're using Windows, the commands might be slightly different.
