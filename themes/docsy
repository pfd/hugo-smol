The `themes/docsy` directory is not a file but a directory that contains the Docsy theme files. These files are not manually created but are installed as a Hugo module. 

To install the Docsy theme as a Hugo module, you need to run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
hugo mod init github.com/myuser/myproject
```

Then, add the following lines to your `config.toml` file:

```toml
[module]
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/google/docsy"
```

After that, you can get the theme by running:

```bash
hugo mod get -u
```

This will download the Docsy theme into the `themes/docsy` directory. 

Please note that these commands are not part of the `themes/docsy` directory but are used to generate it.
